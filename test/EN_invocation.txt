Lithuania! My fatherland! you are like health.

How much you need to value, he will only find out

Who lost you. Today is your beauty in all its ornaments

I can see and describe because I miss you.

 

Holy Virgin, you defend Jasna CzÄ™stochowa

And you shine in Ostra Brama! You, what a castle stronghold

You protect Nowogrodek with his faithful people!

As a child, you miraculously recovered me

(When from a crying mother under your protection

Sacrificial, dead, I lifted my eyelid

And immediately I was able to walk to your doorstep temples

To go for the restored life to thank God),

This is how you will miraculously return us to the Motherland.

Meanwhile, convey my longing soul

To these forest hills, to these green meadows,

Spread wide over the blue Nemunas;

To these fields painted with various grains,

Gilded with wheat, silver-plated with rye;

Where amber scabies, white buckwheat like snow,

Where the sticks of the wood are blush with maidenly blush,

All girded with a ribbon, with copper

Green, on it there are rarely silent pear trees.
