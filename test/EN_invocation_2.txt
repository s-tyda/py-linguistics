Lithuania, my country! You are as good health:
How much one should prize you, he only can tell
Who has lost you. Your beauty and splendour I view
And describe here today, for I long after you.

Holy Virgin who shelters our bright Częstochowa
And shines in Ostra Brama! You, who yet watch over
The castled Nowogródek’s folk faithful and mild;
As You once had returned me to health, a sick child,
(When by my weeping mother into Your care given,
I by miracle opened a dead eye to heaven,
And to Your temple’s threshold could straightaway falter
For a life thus returned to thank God at the altar)
Thus to motherland’s breast You will bring us again.

Meanwhile, bear my soul heavy with yearning’s dull pain,
To those soft woodland hillocks, those meadows, green, gleaming,
Spread wide along each side of the blue-flowing Niemen,
To those fields, which by various grain painted, there lie
Shimmering, with wheat gilded, and silvered with rye…
